  <summary><h2>HOW DO WE TALK WITH COMPUTERS<h2></summary>

 <h3>WHAT IS A PACKAGE</h3>

- PACKAGE IS THE OUTER COVERING, WHICH PROTECTS THE CHIP WITHING ITSELF.
 
- THE CHIP, WHICH CONTAILS THE INSTUCTIONS IS PLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACKAGE
   
- THE CONNECTIONS FROM THE WIRE TO THE CHIP ARE WIREBOUND.
  
- PACKAGES ARE GIVEN NAMES SUCH AS QFN-48 ETC.

 <h3>WHEN WE OPEN UP A CHIP</h3>

- WHEN WE OPEN UP A CHIP WE FIND VARIOUS DIFFERENT COMPONENTS SUCH AS PADS, DIE AND CORE

- THE PADS HELP IN TRANSFERING INSTRUCTIONS FROM INSIDE THE CHIP TO OUTSIDE THE CHIP. THEY ARE PRESENT IN THE BOUNDRY OF THE CHIP.

- THE CORE CONTAINS THE DIGITAL LOGIC OF THE CHIP.

- BOTH TOGETHER, (CORE AND PADS) MAKE UP THE DIE. THIS IS THE BASIC FUNTIONING UNIT OF SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY.

 <h3>FOUNDRY</h3>

- FOUNDRY IS THE PLACE WHERE THE SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS ARE MANIFACTURED. 

- IT IS LIKE A FACTORY CONTAING VARIOUS MACHINES TO MAKE CHIPS.

 <h3>RISC-V INSTRUCTION SET ARCHITECTURE</h3>

 - IT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A LANGUAGE THROUGH WHICH WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE COMPUTER.

 - TO RUN A C-PROGAM ON A PARTICULAR HARDWARE LAYOUT WE NEED TO PASS THIS INFORMATION INTO THE HARDWARE. TO DO THIS THERE IS A PARTICULAR FLOW -

 <h3>FLOW TO PASS INORMATION OF THE C-PROGRAM TO THE HARDWARE LAYOUT</h3>

 - FIRST, THE C-PROGRAM IS COMPILED IN ITS RISC-V ASSEMBLY LANGAUGE PROGRAM.
 
 - THEN IT IS CONVERTED INTO MACHINE LANGUAGE PROGRAM WHICH IS THE BINARY LANGAUGE PROGRAM.

 - AFTER THIS, THE BITS GET EXCECUTED IN THE LAYOUT OF THE HARDWARE.

<h3>APPLICATION POINT OF VIEW  OF THE FLOW</h3>

- THE SOFTWARE WE RUN IN OUR DAY TO DAY LIVES RUNS ON A PARTICULAR HARDWARE PRESENT IN OUR LAPTOPS/CPU'S.

- THE FLOW OF THE INSTRUCTION SET IS AS FOLLOWS

 1. FIRST THE INSTRUCTION SET ENTERS INTO A BOX CALLED SYSTEM SOFTWARE, WHERE THE APPLICATION PROGRAM IS CONVERTED INTO BINARY LANGAUGE. THE COMPONENTS OF THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE ARE OS, COMPILER AND ASSEMBLER.
 2. OS - THE OPERATING SYSTEM OR THE OS DOES VARIOUS JOBS SUCH AS HANDLING IO OPERATIONS, ALLOCATES MEMORY, ETC. ASIDE THESE TASKS THE MAIN OPERATION OF THE OS IS TO HELP IN CONVERSION OF THE APPLICATION LANGAUGE TO THE ASSEMBLY LANGAUGE SO THAT IT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE HARDWARE.
 3. COMPILER - THE COMPILER TAKES THE FUNCTION IN C, C++, JAVA LANGAGES AND CONVERTS IT INTO INSTRUCTIONS.
 4. ASSEMBLER - THE ASSEMBLER TAKES THERE INSTRUCTIONS ARE CONVERTS THEM INTO THERE RESPECTIVE BINARY INSTRUCTIONS.

  <summary><h2>INTRODUCTION TO SOC DESIGN AND OPENLANE<h2></summary>
<h3>ASIC</h3>
- TO DESIGN A APPLICATION SPECIFIC INGRETED CIRCUIT IN A AUTOMATED WAY THE MAIN COMPONENTS OR TOOLS REQUIRED
1. RTL IP'S - THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DIGITAL LOGIC
2. EDA TOOLS - THE SOFTWARE FOR DESIGNING AND SYNTHESIS
3. PDK KITS - CONTAINS FABRICATION RELATED INFORMATION.

<h3>PDK KITS</h3>

- THE PDK OR THE PROCESS DESIGN KIT ACTS AS A INTERFACE BETWEEN THE FABS AND THE DESIGNERS.

- IT CONTAINS VARIOUS TOOLS SUCH AS THE PROCESS DESIGN RULES: DRK, LVS, PEX, DEVICE MODELS, DIGITAL STANDARD CELL LIBRARIES, I/O LIBRARIES ETC.

<h3>SIMPLIFIED RTL TO GDSII FLOW</h3>

- THE SIMPLIFIED FLOW CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING STEPS -

- SYNTHESIS -
  1. SYNTHESIS CONVERTS RTL TO A CIRCUIT OUT OF COMPONENTS FROM THE CIRCUIT CELL LIBRARY.
  2. THESE CELLS HAVE REGULAR/STANDARD LAYOUT.

- FLOOR PLANNING AND POWER PLANNING -
  1. HELPS IN PLANNING THE PLACEMENT OF VARIOS PARTS OF A CHIP. IN MACRO FLOOR PLANNING DIMENSIONS, PIN LOCATIONS AND ROWS ARE PLANNED.
  2. IN THE POWER PLANNING THE POWER NETWORK IS CONSTRUCTED. POWER PINS ARE PLACED AND CONNECTED TO METAL STRAPS.

- PLACEMENT -
  1. THE CELLS ARE PLACED ON THE FLOORPLAN ROWS AND ALIGNED WITH THE SITES.
  2. IT IS USUALLY DONE IN 2 STEPS - GLOBAL AND DETAILED.

 - CTS OR CLOCK DISTRIBUTION NETWORK-
   1. IT IS DONE TO DELIVER THE CLOCK TO ALL SEQUENTIAL ELEMENTS
   2. TO DELIVER WITH MINIMUM SKEW AND DELAY (0 IS HARD TO ACHIEVE).

  - ROUTING -
   1. DONE TO INTERCONNECT USING METAL LAYERS.
   2. METAL TRACKS ARE USED TO FORM A ROUTING GRID. ROUTING GRIDS ARE HUGE.
   3. TO EASE THE PROCESS WE CAN DIVIDE AND CONQUER USING THESE TWO APPROACHES.
      A. GLOBAL ROUTING: GENERATES ROUTING GUIDES.
      B. DETAILED ROUTING: USES THESE GUIDES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTUAL WIRING.

  - SIGN OUT -
  1. IN THIS PROCESS PHYSICAL AND TIMING VERIFICATIONS ARE DONE.
  2. PHYSICAL VERIFICATIONS - dESIGN RULES CHECKING AND LAYOUT VS. SCHEMATIC.
  3. TIMING VERIFICATION - STATIC TIMING ANALYSIS.
